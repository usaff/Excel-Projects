📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes emergency department data to assess patient flow, wait times, admission rates, and other critical hospital metrics. The goal is to uncover inefficiencies, improve patient care, and optimize resource allocation.

🔍 Why This Project?
Emergency departments play a crucial role in healthcare, but overcrowding, long wait times, and inefficient patient handling can impact service quality. By analyzing historical data, we can:
✔️ Identify factors contributing to delays.
✔️ Improve patient management strategies.
✔️ Enhance overall hospital efficiency.

📊 Key Insights
✔️ Patient Volume: The dataset contains 1,001 patient records.
✔️ Admissions: 58.5% of patients were admitted, while 41.5% were not admitted.
✔️ Wait Time: The average patient wait time is 34.93 minutes, highlighting potential service bottlenecks.
✔️ On-Time Treatment: 41.7% of patients were attended to on time, while 58.3% experienced delays—suggesting room for operational improvements.
✔️ Demographics: More female patients (53.5%) than male patients (46.3%).
✔️ Age Group Trends: The 20-29 and 60-69 age groups had the highest number of emergency visits.
✔️ Referral Gaps: Most patient records have "None" as the department referral, indicating possible data entry issues.
