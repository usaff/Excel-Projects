## ❤️ Why This Project? (A Real-World Perspective)  

It was a cold winter night when Sarah rushed her father to the emergency department. He was struggling to breathe, his face pale, and his hands trembling. The waiting room was crowded—patients of all ages anxiously waiting for their turn. Sarah pleaded with the front desk, but the overwhelmed staff could only offer one response:  
*"Please wait, we are doing our best."*  

Minutes felt like hours. Her father’s condition worsened, yet the doctors were still occupied with other critical patients. By the time he was seen, he required intensive care—something that could have been avoided with better patient flow management.  

Sarah’s experience is not unique. Thousands of families face similar struggles daily. Overcrowding, long wait times, and poor resource management in emergency departments can be a matter of life and death. This project aims to **identify bottlenecks, optimize workflows, and ultimately save lives.**
